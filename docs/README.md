## Files

### Data Management Systems.pdf

This document provides an in-depth overview of different data management systems. It covers the architectures, functionalities, and comparative analysis of data warehouses, data lakes, and data lakehouses. Refer to this document for a comprehensive understanding of how different data management systems (warehouse, lake and lakehouses) are structured and their use cases in modern data environments.

### Delta Lake Tables.pdf

This PDF focuses on Delta Lake, a storage layer that brings transactions to Apache Spark and other big data workloads (Databricks in our case) using PySpark. It explains the creation, management, and optimization of Delta Lake tables. Use this document as a guide for implementing Delta Lake tables, understanding their benefits, and learning best practices for maintaining them.

### Create_compute.pdf

This file details the process of creating compute resources. It covers the setup, configuration, and management of compute resources necessary for running data processing tasks. This document is essential for users looking to understand the steps involved in setting up compute environments for data processing workflows.
